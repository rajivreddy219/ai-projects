Here I will be posting some of the data science and machine learning projects that I have been working on. I started learning deep and machine learning from Nov, 2020 and thought of publishing all my work in the form of a blog. 

The first thing that comes to my mind when I hear machine/deep learning is Telsa. How cool are those Self-driving cars!!! The machine itself learning to drive the car without any human interaction is an interesting topic. And also they achieved this feat with almost full accuracy. This made me have an interest in data science and deep learning.

My Learning Process:
1. Initially I started to learn Python and Pytorch basics. 
2. Then I watched some of the [cs231n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i94OvYb6noo) classes by Fei-Fei Li, Andrej Karpathy and Justin Johnson.
3. In order to learn Fastai, I watched this youtube playlist of [fastai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QUEXsHfsA0&list=PLfYUBJiXbdtRL3FMB3GoWHRI8ieU6FhfM) by Jeremy Howard (founder of fastai).
4. Later I learned Pytorch-Lightning and Huggingface transforms.
Some of my projects are trained at low epochs due to the huge data and high computations. So, I ran some notebooks on Google Colab where there is huge data and high computations (Eg: All Fastai projects are run on Google Colab). I also limited the number of epochs to 5-10 for some projects if the computational time taken is too high. The accuracy may increase if the number of epochs is high.


Procedure:
1. Fetch data.
2. Process and Clean the data.
3. Convert the data to respective DataLoaders.
4. Build a Neural Network or use any predefined Fastai model.
5. Train the data.
6. Validate the data.
7. Test the data (predict the data and evaluate the results).


Datasets used - FashionMNIST, Imdb, Kaggle Cats&Dogs, Iris, Bouston-Housing, CIFAR
Data science libraries - Pytorch, Pytorch-Lightning, Fastai and Huggingface Transforms
